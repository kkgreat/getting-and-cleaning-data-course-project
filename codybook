Process

The script project.script.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:

Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.

Reads features.txt and uses only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Reads activity_labels.txt and applies human readable activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Labels the data set with descriptive names. 

Merges the features with activity labels. The result is saved as tidyData.csv.


Variables
